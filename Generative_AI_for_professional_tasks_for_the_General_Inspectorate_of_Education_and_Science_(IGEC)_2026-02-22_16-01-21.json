    "description": "- **Main Goal**: This 3-day training develops IGEC staff's digital competences, enabling them to work confidently, responsibly, and efficiently with generative AI. Participants will progress from a foundational understanding of AI technology and governance to practical mastery of prompting techniques, RAG-based document analysis, and the creation of structured outputs for professional activities. A critical objective is to establish organisational capacity through the collaborative development of shared prompt libraries that ensure consistency across IGEC teams, capture expert methodologies, and support staff onboarding. Staff will enhance their capability to support schools in responsible AI adoption whilst developing critical awareness of appropriate use, limitations, ethical implications, and auditability requirements. The expected outcome is that IGEC will integrate AI-enhanced workflows into inspection practices whilst preserving professional judgement, transparency, and high standards of educational quality and integrity.\n- **Delivery mode**: Days 1 and 2 are delivered in a hybrid format, whilst Day 3 is reserved for in-person collaborative work.\n- The **methodology **integrates peer learning through group work, case study analysis, hands-on practice and reflection.\n\nN.B.: The trainer is using a non-traditional approach: not a standard slide deck, but an HTML file that participants can browse independently (projected and distributed). They can share the full set of slides/outputs at the end of a webinar/session if required, even though the primary delivery format is not PowerPoint-based.",

Rules/knowledge are primarily specified by humans.\n- **Connectionist AI:** models cognition using networks of weighted units (neural networks) and mathematical functions; behaviour is learned via optimisation (e.g., gradient descent), typically from data.\n- **Data-driven AI:** learns patterns/statistical regularities from datasets to make predictions or generate outputs; humans shape behaviour through dataset design/curation, labelling, objective functions, and post-training methods (e.g., fine-tuning, RLHF). Often—but not exclusively—implemented with connectionist models.\n---\n\n## Three magic ingredients of today's AI\nWhy is it working now when it failed before?\n1. **Mountains of data**: the internet has given us more text, images and videos than humanity has produced in its entire history\n2. **Phenomenal computing power**: graphics processing units (GPUs), originally created for video games, are proving to be perfect for AI\n3. **Brilliant algorithms**: notably \"transformers\" (2017), which enable AI to understand context like never before\n![](https://github.com/jourde/GenAI-training-IGEC/blob/main/images/3-ingredients-AI.png?raw=true)",

It enables learners to engage, create with, manage, and design AI, while critically evaluating its benefits, risks, and ethical implications.\n---\n\n## Relationship to Other Topics and Disciplines\n![](https://github.com/jourde/IGEC/blob/main/images/AIlitteracy_relationship.png?raw=true)\n---\n\n## Four domains of AI literacy\n= different ways in which learners interact with AI, encompassing 22 competences.\n.\n![](https://github.com/jourde/IGEC/blob/main/images/AI-competences.png?raw=true)\n.\n![](https://github.com/jourde/IGEC/blob/main/images/fourdpomainsofAIlitteracy.jpg?raw=true)\n--\n- **Engaging with AI** involves using AI as a tool to access new content,information, or recommendations. These situations require learners to first recognize AI’s presence, then evaluate the accuracy and relevance of AI outputs. Learners must develop a fundamental understanding of AI’s technicalfoundations in order to critically analyze its capabilities and limitations.\n- **Creating with AI** consists of collaborating with an AI system in acreative or problem-solving process. It involves guiding and refining AI output through prompts and feedback, while ensuring the content remains fairand appropriate. It also involves ethical considerations related to contentownership, attribution, and the responsible use of existing materials.\n- **Managing AI** requires intentionally choosing how AI can support andenhance human work. This includes assigning structured tasks to AI, such as organizing information, so humans can focus on areas requiring creativity,empathy, and judgment. AI systems can simulate a variety of roles, acting asan analyst, debate partner, or career guide. Learners who manage AI’s actions learn to delegate tasks thoughtfully, guide AI outputs with clear instructions,and assess whether AI’s role aligns with their goals and values. This domainhelps learners build agency, ensuring that AI works for them and that its useremains ethical and human-centered.\n- **Designing AI** empowers learners to understand how AI works andconnect it to its social and ethical impacts by shaping how AI systems function. Through hands-on exploration in an education context, students examine howdata, design choices, and model behavior influence the fairness, usefulness, and impact of AI systems. The goal is not to develop commercial products orput them into service, but to build the confidence and capacity to shape AI for human good by understanding the principles underpinning the design of AI from an early age.\n---\n## Anatomy of a competence\n![](https://github.com/jourde/GenAI-training-IGEC/blob/main/images/anatomy_of_a_competence.png?raw=true)",

                  "presentation": "## Optimising RAG with Structured Content\nTo improve the performance of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, the format of the retrieved data is just as important as the content itself. \n### 1. Why Structure Matters\n* **Lighter Prompts:** Highly structured content requires fewer instructions (you don't need to explain how to read the data if the format is inherently logical).\n* **Increased Accuracy:** LLMs are statistically better at extracting specific values from structured formats than from \"wall-of-text\" paragraphs.\n* **Contextual Clarity:** Structured data allows the AI to immediately identify relationships between entities (e.g., a \"Name\" linked to a \"Participant ID\").\n\n### 2. Preferred Text-Based Formats\nFor RAG, two formats stand out as the industry standards:\n#### **Markdown (.md)**\n* **Best for:** Hierarchical documents, manuals, and articles.\n* **Why:** It uses simple headers (`#`, `##`) and tables that LLMs understand perfectly. It preserves document structure without the overhead of heavy code.\n> [What is Markdown? Getting started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)\n#### **JSON (.json)**\n* **Best for:** Technical data, specifications, and database records.\n* **Why:** It provides a strict **Key-Value** pair relationship. This is ideal for when you need the GenAI to perform specific lookups or comparisons (e.g., \"Find the dimensions of Part X\").\n\n### 3. The Result\nBy providing structured snippets, you can **omit complex parameters** or lengthy explanations in your system prompt. The AI treats the structure as the roadmap, leading to faster processing and more reliable outputs.\n\n---\n## Why Markdown (MD) is Superior for RAG Pipelines\n\nConverting documents from layout-heavy formats (PDF, Word) into **Markdown (MD)** is a strategic optimisation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. While PDFs are designed for human eyes, Markdown is built for machine readability and structural clarity.\n\n### 1. Structural Preservation (Semantic Hierarchy)\n* **Headers as Anchors:** Markdown uses simple syntax (`#`, `##`, `###`) to denote hierarchy. This allows the RAG system to understand which \"chunk\" belongs to which section, preserving the relationship between a subheading and its content.\n* **Tables and Lists:** In a PDF, a table is often just a collection of floating text. In Markdown, tables are structured as rows and columns, allowing the LLM to perform accurate data lookups (e.g., matching a price to a specific part number).\n\n### 2. Token Efficiency & Noise Reduction\n* **Stripping Metadata:** PDF and Word files contain hidden formatting code, font data, and page coordinates. Converting to MD removes this \"noise,\" ensuring that every token sent to the LLM is actual, useful information.\n* **Cleaner Chunking:** It is much easier to split a document logically at a Markdown header than at an arbitrary page break, which often cuts sentences or context in half.\n\n### 3. Improved Retrieval Accuracy\n* **Better Embeddings:** When text is clean and logically ordered, the **Embedding Model** creates more accurate mathematical vectors. This leads to higher \"hit rates\" during the search phase—meaning the AI finds the correct answer more consistently.\n* **Contextual Weight:** Markdown makes it easier for the system to keep the \"parent\" context (like a chapter title) attached to a small snippet of text, giving the LLM the full picture even if it only sees one paragraph.\n\n### 4. LLM \"Native\" Language\nMost Large Language Models are trained extensively on web data, documentation, and code repositories. Consequently, **Markdown is the format LLMs understand most naturally**, leading to faster processing and more coherent reasoning.\n\n### Summary of Benefits\n\n| Feature | PDF / Word | Markdown (MD) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Structure** | Visual/Layout based | Logical/Semantic |\n| **Noise** | High (Metadata/Fonts) | Low (Pure Text) |\n| **Searchability** | Fragmented | Integrated |\n| **LLM Parsing** | Difficult/Variable | Highly Reliable |\n\n---\n## How to convert a document into MD or JSON?\n- Many options...",

Common examples include decision trees, clustering algorithms, classification algorithms, or regression algorithms. |\n| Anonymisation | In the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 2018), anonymisation refers to the processing of data with the aim of irreversibly preventing the identification of an individual person. |\n| Antivirus software | A computer program designed to prevent, detect and remove malware. Also referred to as anti-malware. |\n| Application/App | A computer program or software application, especially one designed to run on a mobile device such as a smartphone, tablet, or watch. |\n| Assistive technologies | An umbrella term for assistive products and their related systems and services. In DigComp, assistive technologies refer to those used in digital environments. Examples include but are not limited to screen readers, adaptive keyboards, alternative input devices, reading assistants, augmented and alternative communication tools, and electronic magnifiers. |\n| Baiting | See Social engineering |\n| Bias | A systematic deviation from a true state. There are different forms of bias, such as the subjective bias of individuals, data and algorithm bias, developer bias and institutionalised biases that are ingrained in the underlying societal context. |\n| Big data | Massive and complex data sets that traditional data management tools cannot handle. Big data can be characterised by large volume, high variety (frequently in unstructured or semi-structured formats), high velocity in generation and processing time, and varying degrees of quality and reliability. |\n| Chatbot | A computer program designed to simulate conversation with a human, usually over the internet, especially one used to provide information or assistance to the user as part of an automated service. |\n| Circular economy model | A system where products and materials are shared, leased, reused, repaired, refurbished and recycled instead of being thrown away. |\n| Clickbait | A text or a thumbnail link that is designed to attract attention and to entice users to click on that link and view, read, stream or listen to the linked piece of online content. The content is typically deceptive, sensationalised, or otherwise misleading. Also referred to as linkbait. |\n| Cloud services | Infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. All infrastructure, platforms, software, or technologies that users access through the internet without requiring additional software downloads can be considered cloud computing services. |\n| Competence statement | In DigComp 3.0, competence statements are short, concrete and technology-neutral descriptions of the kinds of capabilities that individuals at Basic, Intermediate, Advanced and Highly advanced levels could be expected to know or apply, for each of the 21 competences. These are shown in Section 3 of the DigComp 3.0 framework. Competence statements are based on the DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes in Annex 2 of the DigComp 3.0 framework and contain all of the key content in the learning outcomes. |\n| Complex (task) | In DigComp 3.0, the term 'complex' is used in reference to proficiency levels and learning outcomes. In these contexts, a complex task is one which is not well-defined and consists of many different and inter-connected parts, and hence is intricate and not easy to understand or complete. Complexity of a task is often described on the basis of task characteristics - however, the experience and characteristics of an individual undertaking a task is also relevant. |\n| Computable and non-computable problems | The distinction between computable and non-computable problems relates to computability, i.e. the ability to determine if a specific problem can be solved by a computer, considering factors such as resources, machines, and solvability within practical limits. If a problem can be solved by a computer, it is computable. If it cannot, it is non-computable. |\n| Computational thinking | Computational thinking in DigComp 3.0 is consistent with the definition of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS): an individual’s ability to recognise aspects of real-world problems which are appropriate for computational formulation and to evaluate and develop algorithmic solutions to those problems so that the solutions could be operationalised with a computer. In DigComp 3.0, computational thinking is considered a transversal competence, i.e. it relates to and facilitates many of the other DigComp competences such as problem solving, information and data, and content creation. |\n| Computer program | A sequence or set of instructions in a programming language for a computer to execute. |\n| Constructive alignment | An interactive system in which teaching and learning activities and assessment tasks are both aligned to intended learning outcomes and reinforce each other. |\n| Copyright | A type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression. |\n| Creative Commons (licences) | A standardised way to grant permission to use creative work under copyright law.
